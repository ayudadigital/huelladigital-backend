/**
 * Basic user journey backend tests.
 *
 * These tests just represent a proof-of-concept and would normally be created using a different programming language and target a remote application instead of performing
 * request to an in-memory application run by Spring's test framework.
 *
 * Bear in mind that running the tests with Spring might be convenient but is not be enough to reproduce a fully functional test/production environment.
